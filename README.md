# OLA-Data-Analyst-Project

#### **Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing booking data from OLA rides in Mumbai over a period of one month. The analysis covers metrics such as booking statuses, ride distances, cancellation reasons, payment methods, customer and driver ratings, and revenue generation. Insights are visualized using **Power BI** and queried through **SQL**.

#### **SQL Query List**

1. **Retrieve All Successful Bookings**  
   **Query**:  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE Booking_Status = 'Success';
   ```  
   **Description**: This query retrieves all records where the booking status is marked as "Success."  
   **Use Case**: Analyze completed rides for revenue generation and customer satisfaction metrics.

2. **Find the Average Ride Distance for Each Vehicle Type**  
   **Query**:  
   ```sql
   SELECT Vehicle_Type, AVG(Ride_Distance) as avg_distance FROM bookings GROUP BY Vehicle_Type;
   ```  
   **Description**: Calculates the average distance covered by each type of vehicle.  
   **Use Case**: Identify vehicle types suitable for long-distance trips.

3. **Get the Total Number of Cancelled Rides by Customers**  
   **Query**:  
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE Booking_Status = 'cancelled by Customer';
   ```  
   **Description**: Counts the total number of bookings cancelled by customers.  
   **Use Case**: Understand cancellation patterns to improve customer experience.

4. **List the Top 5 Customers Who Booked the Highest Number of Rides**  
   **Query**:  
   ```sql
   SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(Booking_ID) as total_rides FROM bookings GROUP BY Customer_ID ORDER BY total_rides DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```  
   **Description**: Retrieves the top 5 customers based on the number of rides booked.  
   **Use Case**: Reward loyal customers and create targeted marketing strategies.

5. **Get the Number of Rides Cancelled by Drivers Due to Personal and Car-Related Issues**
